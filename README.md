## How to Use

Follow these steps to use the executable version:

1. **Download the Executable**

   Download the executable file from the GitHub repository's "Releases" section.

2. **Run the Executable**

   Double-click the downloaded executable file to run it. You may need to grant necessary permissions if prompted by your operating system.

3. **Input File**

   You will be prompted to enter file containing a list of email addresses. The file should contain one email address per line and in the same directory.

4. **Domains to Keep**

   You can specify the domains you want to keep by entering them as a comma-separated list. For example: `gmail.com,aol.com`. If you want to keep all domains, simply press Enter without entering any domains.

5. **Suffixes to Keep**

   Similarly, you can specify the suffixes you want to keep by entering them as a comma-separated list. For example: `fr,uk`. If you want to keep all suffixes, press Enter without entering any suffixes.

6. **Output File**

   The cleaned email addresses will be saved to a file named `cleaned_emails.txt` in the same directory as the executable.

7. **Completion**

   After processing the input file, the executable will inform you of the location where the cleaned emails have been saved.

## Example

Here's an example of how the executable can be used:

1. Double-click the executable file to run it.

2. Enter the path to the input file: `input.txt`

3. Enter domains to keep (comma-separated, leave empty to keep all): `gmail.com`

4. Enter suffixes to keep (comma-separated, leave empty to keep all): [Press Enter]

The executable will process the input file, keep only the email addresses with the domain `gmail.com`, and save the cleaned list to `cleaned_emails.txt`.

## Note

Make sure the mail list text file and the `List Cleaner.exe` program are in the same directory for the program to work correctly.

Happy cleaning!
